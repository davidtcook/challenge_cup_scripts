This is based on the following "specification" given to me :

# Spec
# =================================================================================

# There will need to be a file containing the ranking list - ranking, name, and points.
# Equal points = equal ranking.  Then skip as discussed, 1,2,2,4  :)
# Output from the script should be an update ranking list in the file.  For bonus points, output it coded as a html table I can cut & paste onto the website ;)
# Input will be a list of name pairs, winner and loser.  I can give it in a file as a literal list of pairs if that makes life easier.
# The loser gets their current points value incremented by 1.
# If the winner is ranked equal or higher than the loser, they get their points incremented by 2.
#otherwise, the winners points are incremented by (Losers_Rank - Winners_Rank)+1.
# Re-sort the ranking list by points and update ranking position before processing the next winner/loser pair.  
# ==================================================================================
